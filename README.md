# StonePaperScissorsWithHandTracking
The model is built using the OpenCV (Library used for vision-based applications) and MediaPipe (Library used for working with audio or video based data) modules. Using the features available to us through these modules, a system is built that helps in tracking the motion of fingers and give back real-time data based on that visual feed.

# Features of the project
1. Stone-Paper-Scissors Game
2. Volume Control using hands
3. Brightness Control using hands
4. Basic handsign recognition
